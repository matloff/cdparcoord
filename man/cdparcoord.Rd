\title{
    Top-frequency parallel coordinates plots.
}

\description{
    A novel approach to the parallel coordinates method for 
    visualization of multiple variables at once, focused on discrete 
    and categorical variables.

    (a) Addresses the screen-clutter problem in parallel coordinates, by
    only plotting the "most typical" cases. These are the tuples with 
    the highest occurrence rates.

    (b) Provides a novel approach to NA values by allowing tuples 
    with NA values to partially contribute to complete tuples rather 
    than eliminating missing values.

    Type \code{?quickstart} for a quick start.
