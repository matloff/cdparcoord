\title{
    Discretize continuous data.
}

\description{
    Converts continuous columns to discrete.
}

\usage{
    discretize(dataset, input, ndigs=0, nlevels=10, presumedFactor=FALSE)
}

\arguments{
    \item{dataset}{
        The dataset to discretize, data frame/table.
    }
    \item{input}{
        Optional specification for partitioning, giving the number of 
        partitions and labels for each partition.  List of lists, one
        list per column to be converted.  The outermost list states
        the columns to be converted, and each inner list holds the name 
        of the column, the number of partitions, and a list of labels 
        for each partition.  
    }
    \item{ndigs}{
        Number of digits to retain in forming labels/values for the
        discretized data, if \code{input} is not supplied. E.g. if
        \code{ndigs} is 2 and the original datum is 38.12, it becomes
        38.
    }
    \item{nlevels}{
        The number of partitions to form for each variable, if \code{
        input} is NULL.  
    }
}

\details{

If \code{input} is not specified, each numeric column in the data will
be discretized, with one exception:  If a column is numeric but has
fewer distinct values than \code{nlevels}, and if \code{presumedFactor}
is TRUE, it is presumed to be an informal R factor and is not converted.
However, it is best to use \code{makeFactor()} on such variables.
