February 2025:

   Default value of 'differentiate' is now TRUE.
 
   New options:
 
      jitterVal: random noise will be added to each column (all must be
      numeric), so that lines don't coincide on each other
 
      sameGraphOption: use of 'grpvar' results in a separate plot
         returned for each level of this variable; 'sameGraphOption'
         plots them together (2 groups only), using different colors
 
      colorPallete: now not limited to 'Jet'

   Legend not shown in some cases  (showscale=FALSE). This resulted in
   some truncation of the right-hand margin. Fixed now.
